== Ansible Tower Concepts

To start using Ansible Tower, some concepts and naming convention should be known.

=== Dashboard

When logged in to Ansible Tower using the web UI, the administrator can view a graph that shows

* recent job activity
* the number of managed hosts
* quick pointers to lists of hosts with problems. 

The dashboard also displays real time data about the execution of tasks completed in playbooks.

=== Projects

image::menu1.png[]

Projects are logical collections of Ansible playbooks in Ansible Tower. These playbooks either
reside on the Ansible Tower instance, or in a source code version control system supported
by Tower.

=== Inventories

image::menu2.png[]

An Inventory is a collection of hosts against which jobs may be launched, the same as an Ansible inventory file. Inventories are divided into groups and these groups contain the actual hosts. Groups may be populated manually, by entering host names into Tower, or from one of Ansible Towerâ€™s supported cloud providers.

=== Credentials

image::menu3.png[]

Credentials are utilized by Tower for authentication when launching Jobs against machines, synchronizing with inventory sources, and importing project content from a version control system. Credential configuration can be found in the Settings.

Tower credentials are imported and stored encrypted in Tower, and are not retrievable in plain text on the command line by any user. You can grant users and teams the ability to use these credentials, without actually exposing the credential to the user.

=== Templates

image::menu4.png[]

A job template is a definition and set of parameters for running an Ansible job. Job templates are useful to execute the same job many times. Job templates also encourage the reuse of Ansible playbook content and collaboration between teams. To execute a job, Tower requires that you first create a job template.

=== Jobs

image::menu5.png[]

A job is basically an instance of Tower launching an Ansible playbook against an inventory of hosts.

== Networking Credentials

Essential for working with networking devices are the credentials used to access the target devices. These can still be provided in the inventory variables. But since the login credentials are often sensitive information, it makes more sense to provide them via Tower directly, in a secure way.

WARNING: This is one of the most important features of Tower: *Credential Separation*! Credentials are defined separately and not with the hosts or inventory settings.

=== Better Safe then Sorry

As this is an important part of your Tower setup, why not make sure I'm not making this up but to check credentials are properly setup for Ansible?

* Open an SSH session to tower.example.com by SSH-ing into the control host and then jumping to Tower. On Tower become user `ansible`:
----
[root@control-<GUID> ~]# ssh tower.example.com
[root@tower ~]# su - ansible
----

* SSH into `csr1.example.com` and `csr2.example.com` and try something `sudo`, this should work without a password! E.g:

----
[ansible@tower ~]$ ssh csr1.example.com
csr1#show version
Cisco IOS XE Software, Version 16.07.01
Cisco IOS Software [Fuji], Virtual XE Software (X86_64_LINUX_IOSD-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 16.7.1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc6)
[...]
csr1#exit
----

TIP: When you execute `show version` the information are shown in a *pager*. You can exit the pager by pressing the button `q`.

=== Configure Networking Credentials

Now let's go and configure the credentials to access our managed hosts from Tower. In the Tower web UI click *Settings*, it is the gear-shaped icon to the upper right. From the settings choose the *Credentials* box. Now:

* Click the *+Add* button to add new credentials
** *Name:* Networking Credentials
** *Organization:* Default

TIP: Whenever you see a magnifiying glass icon next to an input field, clicking it will open a list to choose from.

** *Type:* Network
** *Username:* admin

As we are using password authentication, you have to provide a password - that can be used to access the networking devices - in the *PASSWORD* field.

Additionally, often network devices require an additional *authorize* step to gain higher privileges. This can be activated via the check box in the part *OPTIONS* underneath the key field. Please do so, and enter the password again in the *AUTHORIZE PASSWORD* field.

You have now setup credentials to use later for your networking devices.

== Create an Inventory

Additionally we need an inventory of your managed networking devices. This is the equivalent of an inventory file in Ansible Engine. There is a lot more to it (like dynamic inventories) but let's start with the basics.

* You should already have the web UI open, if not: Point your browser to *https://tower-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com*, accept the certificate and log in as `admin`

Create the inventory:

* In the web UI go to *Inventories* and click *+ Add*
* *Name:* `Networking Inventory`
* *Organization:* Default
* Click *Save*

Add your managed hosts:

* In the inventory view click the *HOSTS* button
* Click the *+Add Hosts* button
* *Host Name:* `csr1.example.com`
* Click *Save*
* Repeat to add `csr2.example.com` as a second host.

You have now created an inventory with two managed hosts.

== Using Variables

You might have seen you can add variables for a host in the inventory. We will use this to enfore the connection type to `lcoal` for all devices in this inventory. This is required for modules of the IOS type.

* Go to *INVENTORIES -> Networking Inventory*
* In the box *VARIABLES* enter `ansible_connection: local` underneath the three existing dashes

* Click *SAVE*

== Add a new Project

A Tower *PROJECT* is a logical collection of Ansible playbooks. You can manage playbooks by either placing them manually on your Tower server, or by placing your playbooks into a source code management (SCM) system supported by Tower, including Git, Subversion, and Mercurial.

You should definitely keep your Playbooks under version control. In this lab we'll use Playbooks kept in a Git repository.

=== Setup Git Repository

For this lab you will use a pre-configured Git repository on `control.example.com` that can be accessed via SSH. A Playbook has already been commited to the repository:

----
TODO: add playbook to Git and afterwards document here
----

TIP: Note the difference to other Playbooks you might have written! Most importantly there is no `become` and `hosts` is set to `all`. Also, `gather_facts` is set to `no`: this is due to the way network devices are currently queried: since the initial connect is local, the `gather_facts` would only gather the facts of the Tower.

To configure and use this repository as a *Source Control Management (SCM)* system in Tower you have to:

* Create credentials to access it using SSH with key authentication
* Create a Project that uses the repository

=== Create Credentials

First we have to create credentials again, this time to access the Git repository over SSH. As you will need the private key of user git (the repo owner) from `control.example.com` for the credentials:

* In a terminal log in to `control.example.com` as root. Then become user git and `cat` the SSH private key:
----
[root@control ~]# su - git
[git@control ~]$ cat .ssh/id_rsa
----

* Copy the complete private key (including *BEGIN* and *END* lines) into the clipboard

In the Tower web UI click the icon for *Settings*. From the settings choose the *CREDENTIALS* box. 

* Click the *+ADD* button to add new credentials
* *NAME*: control git
* *TYPE*: `Source Control`
* *USERNAME*: git
* Paste the SSH private key for the git user from control.example.com into the box
* Click *SAVE*

=== Create the Project

* In the *PROJECTS* view click *+ADD*
* *NAME:* Control Git Repo
* *ORGANIZATION:* Default
* *SCM TYPE:* *Git*
* Point to the Git repo on the control host: 
** *SCM URL:* `control.example.com:/home/git/git-repo`
* *SCM CREDENTIAL:* `control git`
* *SCM UPDATE OPTIONS:* Tick all three boxes to always get a fresh copy of the repository and to update the repository when launching a job.
* Click *SAVE*

TIP: The new Project will be synced after creation automatically. 

Sync the Project again with the Git repository by going to the *PROJECTS* view and clicking the cloudy *START AN SCM UPDATE* icon to the right of the Project.

* After starting the sync job, go to the *JOBS* view, find your job and have a look at the details.

== Create a Job Template and Run a Job

A job template is a definition and set of parameters for running an Ansible job. Job templates are useful to execute the same job many times. So before running an Ansible *Job* from Tower you must create a *Job Template* that pulls together:

* Inventory: On what hosts should the job run?
* Credentials for the hosts
* Project: Where is the Playbook?
* What Playbook to use?

Okay, let's just do that:

* Go to the *TEMPLATES* view and click *+ADD* -> *Job Template*
** *NAME:* `Networking Template`
** *JOB TYPE:* Run
** *INVENTORY:* `Networking Inventory`
** *PROJECT:* `Control Git Repo`
** *PLAYBOOK:* `TODO`
** *CREDENTIAL:* Here you need to pick two: first, pick the `Demo Credential`, and afterwards, in the crendetial dialog, click on the drop down menu *CREDENTIAL TYPE*, click on *Network*, and pick the previously created `Networking Credentials`
** Click *SAVE*

Start a Job using this Job Template by going to the *TEMPLATES* view and clicking the rocket icon. Have a good look at the information the view provides.

TIP: This will take a couple of minutes because you configured the Project to update the SCM on launch. 

After the Job has finished go to the *JOBS* view:

* All jobs are listed here, you should see directly before the Playbook run an SCM update was started. 
* This is the Git update we configured for the *Project* on launch!

== Create a Survey (TODO)

You might have noticed the *ADD SURVEY* button in the *TEMPLATE* configuration view. A survey is a way to create a simple form to ask for parameters that get used as variables when a *TEMPLATE* is launched as a *JOB*.

You have installed Apache on both hosts in the job you just run. Now we're going to extend on this, the task is to:

* Create a Playbook and a Jinja2 template to deploy an _index.html_ file
* The content of the _index.html_ should result from a survey
* Add the Playbook and _index.html_ template to the Git repository.
* Create a Template with a survey
* Launch it

=== Create the index.html Jinja Template

In the SSH console on host control.example.com as user `git` create the _index.html_ template as _/home/git/git-work/index.j2_ with the following content: 
----
<body>
<h1>Apache is running fine</h1>
<h1>This is survey field "First Line": {{ first_line }}</h1>
<h1>This is survey field "Second Line": {{ second_line }}</h1>
</body>
----

TIP: Note the two variables used in the template!

=== Create the Playbook

Again as user `git` create the playbook _/home/git/git-work/index_html_create.yml_ to distribute the index.html file from the template:
----
---
- name: Create index.html from template
  hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: Create index.html
    template:
      src: index.j2
      dest: /var/www/html/index.html
      owner: root
      group: root
      mode: 0644
----

=== Add the Files to Git

Now add the files to Git, commit and push to origin:
----
[git@control ~]$ cd /home/git/git-work
[git@control git-work]$ git add index_html_create.yml
[git@control git-work]$ git add index.j2
[git@control git-work]$ git commit -a -m "index.j2 and playbook added"
[git@control git-work]$ git push origin master
----

TIP: In real world scenarios you would structure your Git (or whatever SCM) in a meaningful way. *And* you would use Ansible Roles, so the location of all files would be clear, instead of having the template file "just" in the Git repo.

Now that we have new content in the Git repo, you can update the *Project* with the new Git content:

* Go to the *Projects* view and start an SCM update for "Control Git Repo" (the cloudy button). 
* Change to the *Jobs* view, look for the job and click it. Watch the output and wait until the job has finished successfully.

TIP: As you've configured the Project to update on launch, this would have happenend anyway.

=== Create a Template with a Survey

Now you create a new Template that includes a survey:

* Go to *Templates* and click *+Add* -> *Job Template*
* *Name:* create index.html
* Set the proper parameters for the job to
** Use the new playbook
** To run on host1.example.com
** To run as root

Try for yourself, the solution is below.

WARNING: *Solution Below!*

* *Name:* create index.html
* *Job Type:* Run
* *Inventory:* Webserver
* *Project:* Control Git Repo
* *Playbook:* index_html_create.yml
* *Machine Credentials:* Example Credentials
* *Options:* Enable Privilege Escalation 
* Click *Save*

==== Add the Survey

* In the Template, click the *Add Survey* button
* Under *Add Survey Prompt* fill in:
** *Prompt:* First Line
** *Answer Variable Name:* first_line
** *Answer Type:* Text
* Click *+Add*
* In the same way add a second *Survey Prompt*
** *Prompt:* Second Line
** *Answer Variable Name:* second_line
** *Answer Type:* Text
* Click *+Add*
* Click *Save* for the Survey
* Click *Save* for the Template

=== Launch the Template

Now go back to the *Template* view and launch *Create index.html*.

* Before the actual launch the survey will ask for *First Line* and *Second Line*. Fill in some text and launch.

TIP: Note how the two survey lines are shown to the left of the Job view as *Extra Variables*.

After the job has completed, check the Apache homepage:

* In the SSH console on control.example.com, run: 
----
[root@control ~]# curl http://host1.example.com
----

You should see how the two variables where used by the playbook to create the content of the index.html file:

----
<body>
<h1>Apache is running fine</h1>
<h1>This is survey field "First Line": line one</h1>
<h1>This is survey field "Second Line": line two</h1>
</body>
----

== Ansible Tower Role Based Access Control

You have already learned how Tower separates credentials from users. Another advantage of Ansible Tower is the user and group rights management.

=== Ansible Tower Users

There are three types of Tower Users:

* *Normal User*: Have read and write access limited to the inventory and projects for which that user has been granted the appropriate roles and privileges.
* *System Auditor*: Auditors implicitly inherit the read-only capability for all objects within the Tower environment.
* *System Administrator*:  Has admin, read, and write privileges over the entire Tower installation. 

Let's create a user:

* Go to *Settings* by clicking the "gear"-icon and choose *USERS*
* Click *+ADD*
* Fill in the values for the new user:
** *FIRST NAME:* `Norbert`
** *LAST NAME:* `Network`
** *EMAIL:* nnetwork@example.com
** *USERNAME:* `nnetwork`
** *USER TYPE:* Normal User
** *PASSWORD:* <as provided>
* Click *SAVE*

=== Ansible Tower Teams

A Team is a subdivision of an organization with associated users, projects, credentials, and permissions. Teams provide a means to implement role-based access control schemes and delegate responsibilities across organizations. For instance, permissions may be granted to a whole Team rather than each user on the Team.

Create a Team:

* Go to *Settings* and choose *TEAMS*.
* Click *+ADD* and create a team named `Network Team`.
* Click *SAVE*

Now you can add a user to the Team:

* Switch to the *Users* view of the `Network Team` by clicking the *USERS* button.
* Click *+ADD* and select the `nnetwork` user.
* The dialog now asks for a role to assign, the following permission settings are available:
** *Admin*: This User should have privileges to manage all aspects of the team
** *Member*: This User should be a member of the team
* Assign the *Member* role.
* Click *SAVE*

Now click the *PERMISSIONS* button in the *Team*  view, you will be greeted with "No Permissions Have Been Granted".

Permissions allow to read, modify, and administer projects, inventories, and other Tower elements. Permissions can be set for different resources.

=== Granting Permissions

To allow users or teams to actually do something, you have to set permissions. The user *nnetwork* should only be allowed to modify content of the assigned webservers.

* In the Permissions view of the Team `Network Team` click the *+ ADD PERMISSIONS* button.
* A new window opens. You can choose to set permissions for a number of resources.
** Select the resource type *JOB TEMPLATES*
** Choose the `TODO` Template by ticking the box next to it.
* The second part of the window opens, here you assign roles to the selected resource.
** Choose *Execute*
* Click *SAVE*

=== Test Permissions

Now log out of Tower's web UI and in again as the *nnetwork* user.

* Go to the *TEMPLATES* view, you should notice for Norbert only the `TODO` template is listed. He is allowed to view and lauch, but not to edit the Template.
* Launch the Job Template, enter the survey content to your liking.
* In the following *JOBS* view have a good look around, note that there where changes to the host (of course...).

Check the result:

* In the SSH console on control.example.com:
----
TODO
----

WARNING: For the next lab log out of the web UI and log in as user *admin* again. 

== Ansible Tower Workflows (TODO)

Workflows where introduced as a major new feature in Ansible Tower 3.1. The basic idea of a workflow is to link multiple Job Templates together. They may or may not share inventory, playbooks or even permissions. The links can be conditional: 

* if job template A succeeds, job template B is automatically executed afterwards
* but in case of failure, job template C will be run. 

And the workflows are not even limited to Job Templates, but can also include project or inventory updates.

TIP: This enables new applications for Tower: different Job Templates can build upon each other. E.g. the networking team creates playbooks with their own content, in their own Git repository and even targeting their own inventory, while the operations team also has their own repos, playbooks and inventory.

In this lab you'll learn how to setup a workflow. 

=== Lab Scenario

You have two departements in your organization:

* The web operations team that is developing Playbooks in their own Git repository.
* The web applications team, that developes really cool JSP web applications for Tomcat in their Git repository.

When there is a new Tomcat server to deploy, two things need to happen:

* Tomcat needs to be installed, the firewall needs to be opened and Tomcat should get started.
* The most recent version of the web application needs to be deployed.

TIP: For the sake of this lab everything needed already exists in Git repositories: Playbooks, JSP-files etc. You just need to glue it together.

=== Set up Projects

First you have to set up the Git repos as Projects like you normally would. You have done this before, try to do this on your own. Detailed instructions can be found below. 

TIP: Because the Git repos are on the same server (control.example.com) and belong to the same user (git) like the one you already configured, you can use the existing credentials.

* Create the project for web operations:
** It should be named *Webops Git Repo*
** The URL to access the repo is *control.example.com:/home/git/git-webops*

* Create the project for the application developers:
** It should be named *Webdev Git Repo*
** The URL to access the repo is *control.example.com:/home/git/git-webdev*

WARNING: *Solution Below*

* Create the project for web operations. In the Projects view click *+Add*
** *Name:* Webops Git Repo
** *Organization:* Default
** *SCM Type:* Git
** *SCM URL:* control.example.com:/home/git/git-webops
** *SCM Credential:* control git
** *SCM Update Options:* Tick all three boxes.
* Click *Save*

* Create the project for the application developers. In the Projects view click *+Add*
** *Name:* Webdev Git Repo
** *Organization:* Default
** *SCM Type:* Git
** *SCM URL:* control.example.com:/home/git/git-webdev
** *SCM Credential:* control git
** *SCM Update Options:* Tick all three boxes.
* Click *Save*

=== Set up Job Templates

Now you have to create *Job Templates* like you would for "normal" Jobs.

* Go to the Templates view and click *+Add* â†’ *Job Template*
** *Name:* Tomcat Deploy
** *Job Type:* Run
** *Inventory:* Example Inventory
** *Project:* Webops Git Repo
** *Playbook:* tomcat.yml
** *Machine Credentials:* Example Credentials
** Enable privilege escalation
* Click *Save*

* Go to the Templates view and click *+Add* â†’ *Job Template*
** *Name:* Web App Deploy
** *Job Type:* Run
** *Inventory:* Example Inventory
** *Project:* Webdev Git Repo
** *Playbook:* create_jsp.yml
** *Machine Credentials:* Example Credentials
** Enable privilege escalation
* Click *Save*

If you want to know what the Playbooks look like:

* Log in via SSH to control.example.com as root
* Have a look at the files in _/home/git/git-webops-work/_ and _/home/git/git-webdev-work/_

=== Set up the Workflow

And now you finally set up the workflow. Workflows are configured in the *Templates* view, you might have noticed you can choose between *Job Template* and *Workflow Job Template* when adding a template so this is finally making sense.

* Go to the *Templates* view and click *+Add* -> *Workflow Job Template*
** *Name:* Deploy Webapp Server
** *Organization:* Default
* Click *Save*
* Now the *Workflow Editor* button becomes active, click it to start the graphical editor.
* Click on the *Start* button, a new node opens. To the right you can assign an action to the node, you can choose between *Jobs*, *Project Sync* and *Inventory Sync*. 
* In this lab we'll link Jobs together, so select the *Tomcat Deploy* job and click *Select*.
* The node gets annotated with the name of the job. Hover the mouse pointer over the node, you'll see a red and green *+* signs appear.

TIP: Using the red plus allows you to remove the node, the green plus lets you add the next node.

* Click the green *+* sign
* Choose *Web App Deploy* as the next Job (you might have to switch to the next page)
* Leave *Type* set to *On Success*

TIP: The type allows for more complex workflows. You could lay out different execution paths for successful and for failed Playbook runs.

* Click *Select*
* Click *Save*

=== And Action

Your workflow is ready to go, launch it.

* In the *Template* view launch the *Deploy Webapp Server* workflow by clicking the rocket icon.
* Wait until the job has finished. 

TIP: Note how the workflow run is shown in the job view and you can choose the workflow nodes to get more information.  

* To check everything worked fine, log into host1.example.com and host2.example.com from control.example.com and run:

----
[root@host1 ~]# curl http://localhost:8080/coolapp/
----

== Set Up and Use System Tracking (TODO)


System Tracking is a cool feature that offers the ability to compare the results of two scan runs from different dates on one host or the same date on two hosts.

WARNING: System Tracking, introduced as a new feature in Ansible Tower 2.2, is only available to those with Enterprise-level licenses!

As System Tracking uses the facts collected by *Scan Runs*, these have to be setup first.

=== Scan Job Templates

Scan jobs are special Job Templates that only collect information about the host on which the job is running.

Set up a scan job template:

* As admin, add a new *Job Template*
** *Name:* scanrun
** *Job Type:* Scan
** *Inventory:* Example Inventory
** Project and Playbook will be automatically set to "Default", leave as is!
** *Machine Credentials:* Example Credentials
** Enable privilege escalation
* Click *Save*

Now run the scan job. Okay, this was nice, but we need another run. So just run the job again.

=== System Tracking

Now to the actual tracking:

* Go to the *Inventories* view and click "Example Inventory"
* Select host1.example.com
* Click the *System Tracking* button.

Tower will display the System Tracking results page. Have a look at the "Packages", "Services" and "Ansible" section. Looks all good apart from the fact there have been no changes...

So to make system tracking more meaningful, we need to change something the scan job is looking for:

* Run an ad hoc command against host1.example.com to install the package *tree*.
* Run the scanrun job template again.
* Run the System Tracking for host1.example.com again.

Now the "Packages" section should show that package *tree* was absent and is now installed.

WARNING: *Solution below*

* Go to the *Inventories* view, choose "Example Inventory"
* Select host1.example.com and click *Run Command*
* Configure the ad hoc command:
** *Module:* yum
** *Arguments:* name=tree state=latest
** *Machine Credentials:* Example Credentials
** Enable privilege escalation
* Click *Launch* and wait for the ad hoc command to finish
* Go to *Templates* and launch the "scanjob" template by clicking the rocket symbol
* Go to *Inventories*, select host1.example.com
* Click the *System Tracking* button.

== Final Lab or Putting it all Together (TODO)

This is the final challenge where we try to put most of what you have learned together. 

=== Let's set the stage

Your operations team and your application development team like what they see in Tower. To really use it in their environment they put together these requirements:

* All webservers (host1.example.com and host2.example.com) should go in one group
* As the webservers can be used for development purposes or in production, there has to be a way to flag them accordingly as "stage dev" or "stage prod".
** Currently host1 is used as a dev system and host2 in production.
* Of course the content of the world famous application "index.html" will be different between dev and prod stages.  
** There should be a headline stating the environment
** There should be a content field
* The content writer `wweb` should have access to a survey to change the content for dev and prod servers.

=== Set up the Git Repository

As a prerequsite you have to setup a new Git repo containing the needed files on control.example.com.

* Login via SSH to control.example.com and become user `git`:
----
[root@control-<GUID> ~]# su - git
----

 * Create the bare Git repo:
----
[git@control-<GUID> ~]$ git init --bare git-webserver
----

* Create the working repo:
----
[git@control-<GUID> ~]$ mkdir git-webserver-work
[git@control-<GUID> ~]$ cd git-webserver-work/
[git@control-<GUID> git-webserver-work]$ git init .
----

* Set the bare repo as origin for the work repo (command is one line):
----
[git@control-<GUID> git-webserver-work]$ git remote add origin git@control.example.com:/home/git/git-webserver
----

* Create the files (a Playbook and two versions of index.html files) in the work repo _/home/git/git-webserver-work/_

_dev_index.html.j2_ 
----
<body>
<h1>This is a development webserver, have fun!</h1>
{{ dev_content }}
</body>
----

_prod_index.html.j2_ 
----
<body>
<h1>This is a production webserver, take care!</h1>
{{ prod_content }}
</body>
----

_stage_content.yml_
----
---
- name: Deploy index.html
  hosts: all
  tasks:

  - name: Creating index.html from template
    template: 
      src: "{{ stage }}_index.html.j2"
      dest: /var/www/html/index.html
----

* Add the files, commit and push to origin:
----
[git@control-<GUID> git-webserver-work]$ git add -A
[git@control-<GUID> git-webserver-work]$ git commit -a -m "initial commit"
[git@control-<GUID> git-webserver-work]$ git push origin master
----

=== Prepare Inventory

There is of course more then one way to accomplish this, but here is what you should do:

* Put both hosts in the inventory group `Webserver`
* Add a variable `stage: dev` to the inventory `Webserver`
* Add a variable `stage: prod` to host2.example.com

=== Create the Project

* Create a new *Project* named `Webcontent` using the new Git repository
** *Credentials*: control git
** *SCM URL*: control.example.com:/home/git/git-webserver

=== Create the Template

* Create a new *Template* named `Create Web Content` that 
** targets the `Webserver` inventory 
** uses the Playbook `stage_content.yml` from the new `Webcontent` Project
** Defines two variables: `dev_content: default dev content` and `prod_content: default prod content`
* Run the template

=== Check the results:

----
[root@control ~]# curl http://host1.example.com
<body>
<h1>This is a development webserver, have fun!</h1>
default dev content
</body>
----
----
[root@control ~]# curl http://host2.example.com
<body>
<h1>This is a production webserver, take care!</h1>
default prod content
</body>
----

=== Add Survey

* Add a survey to the Template to allow changing the variables `dev_content` and `prod_content` and make it available to user `wweb`.
* Run the survey as user `wweb`
* Check the results:
----
[root@control ~]# curl http://host1.example.com
<body>
<h1>This is a development webserver, have fun!</h1>
This is somehow in development
</body>
----
----
[root@control ~]# curl http://host2.example.com
<body>
<h1>This is a production webserver, take care!</h1>
This is my nice Prod Content
</body>
----

=== Solution

WARNING: *Solution Not Below*

You have done all the required configuration steps in the lab already. If unsure, just refer back to the respective chapters. 

== Optional: Ansible Tower Administration (TODO)

Because the installation process takes a fair amount of time your Ansible Tower instance was already installed for you.

But some words regarding the installation and basic administration should be in order. You should already have an SSH session open.

=== Tower Installation

Installation of Tower is really straight forward... I mean it's handled by Ansible. 

* You download (preferably) the setup-bundle and unpack it on a minimal-install-RHEL machine.

TIP: The setup-bundle installer includes all software so there will be no third-party Yum repos configured on the server... looks better in front of a customer.

* You edit the inventory file and in the most simple case just put in a couple of passwords
* You run `setup.sh` and lean back.

TIP: For more options like an external database refer to the fine documentation.

Have a look at your lab VM:

* Change into the installer directory:
----
[root@tower ~]# cd /root/ansible-tower-setup-bundle-3.x.x.x.x/
----

* Have a look at the inventory file
----
[root@tower ansible-tower-setup-bundle-3.x.x.x.x]# cat inventory 
[tower]
localhost ansible_connection=local
[...]

=== Basic Administration: Starting, Stopping, and Restarting Tower

Ansible Tower includes an admin utility script, `ansible-tower-service`, that can start, stop, and restart the full tower infrastructure including the database and message queue. It resides in `/usr/bin/ansible-tower-service`.

On your Tower VM, run:

----
[root@tower ~]# ansible-tower-service restart
----

And to get the status:

----
[root@tower ~]# ansible-tower-service status
----

=== Managing Tower with `tower-manage`

The tool `tower-manage` can be used for a variety of administration tasks.

On the Tower SSH console run the command to get an overview of the available commands:
----
[root@tower ~]# tower-manage  --help
----

As a starting point here are some examples. Run the commands and check the results in the web UI.

* Change the password for a Tower user:
----
[root@tower ~]# tower-manage changepassword admin
Changing password for user 'admin'
Password: 
Password (again): 
Password changed successfully for user 'admin'
----

* Remove old jobs, project and inventory updates from the database.
----
[root@tower ~]# tower-manage cleanup_jobs -h # get help
----
Let's remove jobs:

----
[root@tower ~]# tower-manage cleanup_jobs --jobs --days=0 --dry-run # dry run
[root@tower ~]# tower-manage cleanup_jobs --jobs --days=0 # do it
----

=== Python Usage in Tower

Tower comes with a lot of Ansible Modules out of the box. But sometimes a Python dependency is missing or you would like to install another module. To separate the Python environments Tower is using a Python mechanism called "virtualenv". 

Virtualenv creates isolated Python environments to avoid problems caused by conflicting dependencies and differing versions. Virtualenv works by simply creating a folder which contains all of the necessary executables and dependencies for a specific version of Python. 

Ansible Tower creates two virtualenvs during installation in the home directory of user `awx` which Tower is running as. One is used to run Tower, while the other is used to run Ansible. This allows Tower to run in a stable environment, while allowing you to add or update modules to your Ansible Python environment.

Have a look on your Tower:

----
[root@tower ~]# ll /var/lib/awx/venv/
----

If you have to modify or install something Python, leave the Tower virtualenv alone to ensure stable operation and  do changes to the virtualenv that Tower uses to run Ansible. Try it yourself:

Become the `awx` user and switch to the Ansible virtualenv:

----
[root@tower ~]# su - awx
-bash-4.2$
-bash-4.2$ . /var/lib/awx/venv/ansible/bin/activate
----

Then you can install whatever you need using pip:

----
(ansible)-bash-4.2$ pip install packaging
----

TIP: This is actually a good example; on Tower 3.1.3 (at least) the Azure modules are not working because the module `packaging` is missing. 

TIP: I'm not 100% sure if this has to be run as user `awx` but as all site-packages files for the virtualenv belong to user `awx` I'm reasonably sure... ;-) 

== Optional: Tower Client (TODO)

The tower-cli tool is a command line tool for Ansible Tower. It allows Tower commands to be easily run from the Unix command line. It can also be used as a client library for other python apps, or as a reference for others developing API interactions with Tower's REST API.

=== Installation

Tower-cli can be installed using pip or from the EPEL repository with Yum. To install tower-cli quick & dirty in your lab environment on control.example.com:

* Open a terminal session to control.example.com 
* As user root run
----
[root@control ~]# rpm -ivh /var/www/html/pub/epel/*
----

=== Configuration

Configuration can be set in several places: tower-cli can edit its own configuration, or users can directly edit the configuration file.

The preferred way to set configuration is with the tower-cli config command. The syntax is:

----
$ tower-cli config key value
----

By issuing tower-cli config with no arguments, you can see a full list of configuration options and where they are set.

In most cases, you must set at least three configuration options (host, username, and password) which correspond to the location of your Ansible Tower instance and your credentials to authenticate to Tower.

* Run:
----
[root@control ~]# tower-cli config host tower.example.com
[root@control ~]# tower-cli config username admin
[root@control ~]# tower-cli config password <Tower Admin PW>
----

=== Examples

Here are some examples, just try a couple of them:

----
# List all users.
$ tower-cli user list

# Create a new user.
$ tower-cli user create --username=guido --first-name=Guido \
                        --last-name="Van Rossum" --email=guido@python.org \
                        --password=password1234

# List all non-superusers
$ tower-cli user list --is-superuser=false

# Get a user by ID.
$ tower-cli user get <id>

# Get the user with the given username.
$ tower-cli user get --username=guido

# Modify an existing user.
# This would modify the first name of the user with the ID of <id> to "Gregor".
$ tower-cli user modify <guido id> --first-name=Gregor

# Modify an existing user, lookup by username.
# This would use "username" as the lookup, and modify the first name.
# Which fields are used as lookups vary by resource, but are generally
# the resource's name.
$ tower-cli user modify --username=guido --first-name=Guido

# Delete a user.
$ tower-cli user delete <id>

# List jobs
$ tower-cli job list

# Launch a job.
$ tower-cli job launch --job-template=<id>

# Monitor a job.
$ tower-cli job monitor <id>
----

=== Getting Help

When in doubt, help is available!

----
$ tower-cli # help
$ tower-cli user --help # resource specific help
$ tower-cli user create --help # command specific help
----
